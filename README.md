# SuperLi: Supermarket Managment System

Analysis, design and implementation of a supermarket management system, developed as part of the course Analysis and Design of Software Systems, 
the project involved 8 students each responsible for a different module consisting of: 

* Employees
* Trucking
* Inventory
* Suppliers

During the several stages of the course we had to integrate the different modules and accommodate for changes and additional requirements from the customer.

the system is designed in a modular and balanced way in the time ratio given to us, as to support those changes.

The implementation is based on 4-lvl-tier with presentation level based on MVVM pattern.
In addition to the implementation there are very detailed analysis and design charts for the entire system such as: class diagram, ERD, DFD, collaboration diagram and more.
